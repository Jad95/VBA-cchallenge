“Introduction”

"All Stocks Analysis" By calculating the total stock volume, the yearly change, and the percent change of each stock's open and closing prices, this macro analyses the performance of stocks over a certain year range.

“Objective”

The macro's goal is to assist users in quickly analysing stock performance data and generating a summary of the best and worst performing stocks.
